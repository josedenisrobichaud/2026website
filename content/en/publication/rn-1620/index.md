abstract: 'The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify current reproduction
  management practices, and (2) assess the association between these practices and
  herd reproductive performance on dairy farms in Canada. A bilingual survey was developed,
  validated, and administered from March to May 2014 to collect general and reproduction
  management and performance measures [annual 21-d pregnancy rate (PR), 21-d insemination
  rate (IR), and conception risk (CR)]. Associations between management practices
  and reproductive performance measures were tested using linear regression models.
  A total of 832 questionnaires were completed online and by mail, representing a
  response rate of 9%. On average, farms had 77 lactating cows (median=50) and 13
  dry cows (median=10), and Holstein was the most common breed (92% of herds). Lactating
  cow housing was tiestall on 61% of the farms, freestall on 37%, and bedded pack
  on 2%. The average voluntary waiting period was 58 d in milk (DIM). The main reproduction
  management practice per farm was defined as the means employed for >50% of inseminations.
  Farms reported their main reproduction management practice for first and subsequent
  inseminations, respectively, as visual estrus detection (51 and 44% of herds), timed
  AI (21 and 23% of herds), automated activity monitoring (AAM; 10 and 10% of herds),
  other management practice (bulls; 2 and 2% of herds), and a combination of management
  practices (16 and 21% of herds). On farms using visual estrus detection, cows were
  observed for signs of estrus on average 3.5 times per day, for an average total
  of 36 min/d. The most common use of reproductive hormones was to synchronize ovulation
  using Ovsynch (58% of the farms). Average PR, IR, and CR were 17.6, 44.1, and 40.5%,
  respectively. In linear regression analyses adjusted for confounders, pregnancy
  rate was significantly associated with geographic region, housing (tiestall: PR=15.4%,
  freestall: PR=17.6%), herd size (<50 lactating cows: PR=16.2%, 50-100 cows: PR=16.5%,
  >100 cows: PR=17.8%), voluntary waiting period (≤60 DIM: PR=17.6%, >60 DIM: PR=15.9%),
  and frequency of insemination per day (once daily: PR=16.6%, twice or more daily:
  PR=18.1%). The main reproduction management practice at first and subsequent inseminations
  was divergently associated with IR and CR, but not with PR (visual heat detection:
  PR=17.4%, timed AI: PR=18.4%, AAM: PR=17.1%, combined practices: PR=18.2%).'

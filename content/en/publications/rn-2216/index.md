abstract: "While One Health initiatives are gaining in popularity, it is unclear if
  and how they are evaluated when implementation at scale is intended. The main purpose
  of this scoping review was to describe how One Health initiatives targeting infectious
  diseases and antimicrobial resistance at a large scale are evaluated. Secondary
  objectives included identifying the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation
  and success of these initiatives, and how their impacts were assessed. Twenty-three
  studies evaluating One Health initiatives were eligible. Most studies included the
  human (n = 22) and animal (n = 15) sectors; only four included the environment sector.
  The types of evaluated initiative (non-exclusive) included governance (n = 5), knowledge
  (n = 6), protection (n = 17), promotion (n = 16), prevention (n = 9), care (n = 8),
  advocacy (n = 10) and capacity (n = 10). Studies used normative (n = 4) and evaluative
  (n = 20) approaches to assess the One Health initiatives, the latter including impact
  (n = 19), implementation (n = 8), and performance (n = 7) analyses. Structural and
  economic, social, political, communication and coordination-related factors, as
  well as ontological factors, were identified as both facilitators and barriers for
  successful One Health initiatives. These results identified a wide range of evaluation
  methods and indicators used to demonstrate One Health's added values, strengths,
  and limitations: the inherent complexity of the One Health approach leads to the
  use of multiple types of evaluation. The strengths and remaining gaps in the evaluation
  of such initiative highlight the relevance of comprehensive, mixed-method, context-sensitive
  evaluation frameworks to inform and support the implementation of One Health initiatives
  by stakeholders in different governance settings."

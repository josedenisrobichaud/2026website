abstract: 'Metritis affects up to 40% of dairy cows and it is usually treated with
  antibiotics. In spite of their advantages, there is an increased concern about antibiotic
  resistance leading to the research of alternative methods. The aim of this study
  was to evaluate the effects of a combination of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the
  prevalence of metritis and modulation of endometrial and neutrophil inflammatory
  markers in dairy cows. One hundred and thirty-five cows were enrolled 3 week before
  calving and randomly assigned to three treatments. Treatment groups were: (1) two
  intravaginal doses of LAB/wk during 3 week pre-calving (vaginal, n = 45); (2) an
  intra-uterine dose, once 1 d after calving (uterine, n = 44); and (3) no intervention
  (CTRL, n = 45). Metritis was defined as body temperature > 39.5°C and purulent vaginal
  discharge (> 50% pus), and diagnosed 6 d after calving. Blood samples were taken
  at d −14, −10, −7, −4, +1, +3, +6, and +14 relative to calving for non-esterified
  fatty acids (NEFA) analysis. At d −10, +1, +3, and +6 neutrophils were isolated
  from blood for gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR. Endometrium biopsies were taken
  from 30 cows, 15 from CTRL and 15 from the uterine group at d +1, +3, and +6 after
  calving for pro-inflammatory markers analysis by NanoString®. Vaginal treatment
  reduced metritis prevalence (6/45) up to 58% compared with CTRL group (14/45), but
  there was no difference between the uterine and CTRL group. Uterine and vaginal
  treatments reduced blood neutrophil gene expression. Expression of pro-inflammatory
  markers in the endometrium did not differ between uterine and CTRL cows. Metritic
  cows expressed more C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) and interleukin 1 beta
  (IL1B) at d 3 than healthy cows, whereas healthy cows expressed more CXCL8 at d
  1 relative to calving in the endometrium. This study shows a promising potential
  of LAB probiotics as a preventive treatment against metritis in dairy cows.'

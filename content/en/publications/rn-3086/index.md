abstract: The ability of automated activity monitoring (AAM) systems to detect estrus
  is influenced by multiple variables. The luteal phase (LP) preceding estrus has
  been shown to be important for hormones release, and behavior during estrus in ruminants,
  but its impact on activity as measured by AAM systems has not been studied. The
  objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the length of the preceding
  LP on the intensity and duration of estrus as measured by AAM, and on the expression
  of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the endometrium. A total of 60 cows between
  46 and 53 days in milk were assigned to either a normal or a short length LP. Length
  of the LP was insured by the use of hormonal synchronization programs. Cows in both
  treatments were matched on parity, milk production, body condition score (BCS),
  and lameness score (assessed at enrolment). Expression of ERα receptors in the endometrium
  were evaluated by nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry of biopsies. Estrus was
  defined as the day on which the AAM system detected estrus. Cows that were not synchronized
  by the protocol or that were not detected in estrus by the AAM systems were excluded,
  which left 21 and 11 cows for analyses in the normal and short length LP, respectively.
  Peak activity index of estrus, duration of estrus, and expression of ERα were outcomes
  for multivariable linear regression models. Cows with short length LP tended to
  have lower peak activity at estrus, but there was no significant effect of treatment
  when BCS was accounted for. Cows with BCS ≤ 2.5 had less intense and shorter estrus
  than cows with BCS ≥ 2.75. There was no association between the length of the LP
  and the expression of ERα in the endometrium.

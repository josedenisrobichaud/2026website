Developing practical decision-support tools that help veterinarians and farmers use farm data to make better, faster health management decisions.

## In brief
Modern dairy farms generate vast amounts of data from sensors, management software, and routine monitoring. However, translating this data into actionable insights remains challenging for both veterinarians and farmers. This project focuses on developing machine learning models and decision-support tools that integrate multiple data sources to assist with animal health management. By working closely with end-users throughout development, we aim to create practical tools that fit into existing workflows and genuinely support on-farm decision-making for issues like disease detection, treatment timing, and preventive care strategies.

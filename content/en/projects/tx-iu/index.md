## In brief

After calving, dairy cows commonly experience bacterial contamination of the uterus, but not all cases lead to clinical disease. The relationship between infection (presence of bacteria) and inflammation (the cow's immune response) is complex and varies among individuals. This project seeks to better understand how these factors interact and affect uterine health and fertility. By clarifying the role of inflammation versus infection, we aim to identify which cows are most likely to benefit from intrauterine treatment with cephapirin. This approach will help refine treatment protocols, promote more judicious use of antimicrobials, and ultimately improve reproductive performance in dairy herds.

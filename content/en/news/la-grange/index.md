The Rimouski campus of the *faculté de médecine vétérinaire* is excited to announce the launch of **La Grange de la Recherche**, a newsletter connecting research with the agricultural community of Bas-Saint-Laurent.

This newsletter aims to bridge the gap between scientific research and the daily realities of local farms. Each edition will keep you informed about ongoing research projects at the Rimouski campus, share opportunities for producer participation in studies, and provide updates from the research team working in the region. Our goal is to ensure that veterinary and agricultural research directly serves the needs of producers and their herds.

La Grange de la Recherche is designed for livestock producers, veterinarians, and stakeholders in the agri-food sector who want to stay connected to research happening in their own backyard. Your input matters—we welcome your feedback and suggestions as we build this resource together.

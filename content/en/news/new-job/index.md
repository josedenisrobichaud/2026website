After years of working as a self-employed researcher and embracing a nomadic lifestyle, I'm excited (and a little awestruck) to share a big life update: This summer, I’ll be joining the Université de Montréal Faculté de médecine vétérinaire at the Rimouski campus. It’s a huge shift — not just professionally, but personally. For the first time in a long while, I’ll be putting down roots. Trading airports and temporary homes for a more grounded rhythm of life. There’s something both tender and thrilling about this moment: saying goodbye to the fluid freedom of the road, and stepping into a role filled with purpose, structure, and community. Rimouski is stunning — a city on the shores of the St. Lawrence River, surrounded by nature and filled with kind, thoughtful people. I’m excited to (re)discover all it has to offer and to contribute to a vibrant academic environment. I’ll be teaching, doing research, and connecting with students and colleagues in new ways. While I’ll always carry the spirit of the road with me, I’m ready for this change. It feels like the right time to build something more lasting — to invest deeply, stay longer, and grow in new directions. To everyone who has supported, and encouraged me on this unconventional path: thank you. Your belief in my journey helped make this next step possible. Here’s to big changes, new roots, and a slower, deeper kind of adventure.

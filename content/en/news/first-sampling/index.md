Since November, our team has begun an exciting research project on uterine health in dairy cows. The goal? To better understand the role of the reproductive tract microbiota in uterine health and fertility of dairy herds.  

This [project]({{< relref "../projects/marqueurs" >}}), led by Marcio Costa, aims to establish links between microbiota composition and reproductive performance in cows. By identifying microbial profiles associated with good uterine health, we hope to develop predictive tools that can help producers optimize reproduction management on their farms.  

Three dairy farms in the region have already participated in this first phase of sample collection. We are thrilled with the warm welcome and collaboration from producers, who understand the importance of this research for the future of the dairy industry. Their active participation and interest in the project are essential to the study's success.  

The data collected during these first visits provide a solid foundation for our analyses. Sample collection will continue throughout 2026, and we look forward to sharing our findings with the veterinary and agricultural community.  

A huge thank you to the producers of Bas-Saint-Laurent for their valuable participation and trust.

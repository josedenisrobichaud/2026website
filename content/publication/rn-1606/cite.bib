 abstract = {<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>The Canadian dairy industry has created national standards to support the adoption of biosecurity practices and to reduce disease risks across the country. There is, however, very little information on the adoption of these practices. The present study aimed to describe the adoption of biosecurity practices on Canadian dairy farms shortly after the creation of the national standards and to identify demographic factors associated with practice adoption. In 2015, 2 questionnaires (phase 1 and 2) were administered to Canadian dairy farmers during an extensive cross-sectional study. Associations between adoption of biosecurity practices as well as associations between adoption of these practices and demographic variables were tested using multiple correspondence analysis. A total of 1,157 questionnaires were completed in phase 1, and a subsample of 368 respondents was selected using stratified random sampling to complete phase 2 during visits to the farms. There was a lack of investigation into general disease syndromes such as a high prevalence of abortion or an unexplained death (38 and 22% of respondents, respectively). Biosecurity measures within herds and between herds to minimize the spread of infection were not widely adopted (e.g., 27% of the respondents never housed sick or lame animals in their calving pen, 41% had closed herds, and 25 and 48% of the open herds had no strategy for introducing new additions and reintroducing returning animals, respectively). Cleanliness of the cows before calving was always ensured by 29% of the respondents, and 27% of the respondents reported always sanitizing the calving pen after each calving. Less than 15% of the respondents had measures in place to limit or control visitors coming on their farm. Moreover, less than half of the respondents reported requiring family members, employees, and visitors to wear farm-designated or clean boots and coveralls. From the multiple correspondence analysis, 2 dimensions were retained and were summarized as "animal movement, calving area, and visitor biosecurity" and "employee biosecurity." Geographical region, type of housing, and milk production were associated with the "employee biosecurity" dimension. The present study demonstrates that many important biosecurity practices are not implemented on Canadian dairy farms; therefore, efforts to promote the adoption of these practices will be necessary to improve biosecurity in dairy herds.</p>},

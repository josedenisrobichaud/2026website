abstract: <h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>The Canadian dairy industry has created national standards
  to support the adoption of biosecurity practices and to reduce disease risks across
  the country. There is, however, very little information on the adoption of these
  practices. The present study aimed to describe the adoption of biosecurity practices
  on Canadian dairy farms shortly after the creation of the national standards and
  to identify demographic factors associated with practice adoption. In 2015, 2 questionnaires
  (phase 1 and 2) were administered to Canadian dairy farmers during an extensive
  cross-sectional study. Associations between adoption of biosecurity practices as
  well as associations between adoption of these practices and demographic variables
  were tested using multiple correspondence analysis. A total of 1,157 questionnaires
  were completed in phase 1, and a subsample of 368 respondents was selected using
  stratified random sampling to complete phase 2 during visits to the farms. There
  was a lack of investigation into general disease syndromes such as a high prevalence
  of abortion or an unexplained death (38 and 22% of respondents, respectively). Biosecurity
  measures within herds and between herds to minimize the spread of infection were
  not widely adopted (e.g., 27% of the respondents never housed sick or lame animals
  in their calving pen, 41% had closed herds, and 25 and 48% of the open herds had
  no strategy for introducing new additions and reintroducing returning animals, respectively).
  Cleanliness of the cows before calving was always ensured by 29% of the respondents,
  and 27% of the respondents reported always sanitizing the calving pen after each
  calving. Less than 15% of the respondents had measures in place to limit or control
  visitors coming on their farm. Moreover, less than half of the respondents reported
  requiring family members, employees, and visitors to wear farm-designated or clean
  boots and coveralls. From the multiple correspondence analysis, 2 dimensions were
  retained and were summarized as \"animal movement, calving area, and visitor biosecurity\"
  and \"employee biosecurity.\" Geographical region, type of housing, and milk production
  were associated with the \"employee biosecurity\" dimension. The present study demonstrates
  that many important biosecurity practices are not implemented on Canadian dairy
  farms; therefore, efforts to promote the adoption of these practices will be necessary
  to improve biosecurity in dairy herds.</p>

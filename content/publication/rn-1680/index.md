abstract: The bacterium Coxiella burnetii has been associated with reproduction disorders
  in dairy cattle. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Québec, Canada, to estimate
  the prevalence of C. burnetii in dairy cows from C. burnetii RT-PCR-positive and/or
  ELISA-positive herds. As a secondary objective, the associations between C. burnetii-positivity
  and three reproductive outcomes (purulent vaginal discharge, cytological endometritis,
  and success at first service) were assessed. A total of 202 post-parturient dairy
  cows from nine herds were sampled at 35 ± 7 days in milk. Vaginal mucus and composite
  milk were collected from each cow and screened for the presence of C. burnetii by
  real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA, respectively. Purulent vaginal discharge and cytological
  endometritis were evaluated using a Metricheck device and a modified cytobrush,
  respectively. The first insemination postpartum was done following an ovulation
  synchronization protocol around 70 days in milk, and success at first service was
  recorded. Multilevel logistic regressions adjusted for parity were used to model
  purulent vaginal discharge, cytological endometritis and success at first service
  according to C. burnetii cow status. All 202 RT-PCR-assayed vaginal samples were
  C. burnetii-negative. A positive result for anti-C. burnetii antibodies detection
  in composite milk was obtained in 25/202 samples and a doubtful result in 4/202
  samples. After adjustment for sampling weights, the 202 ELISA-assayed composite
  milk samples gave an estimated overall prevalence of C. burnetii positive cows of
  12.9 % (CI = 6.1–19.6 %) and of doubtful cows of 1.4 % (CI = 0.0–3.3 %). The proportion
  of ELISA-positive cows was lower in first parity (0%) compared to second (17.1 %)
  or third parity cows (20.0 %). The associations between ELISA positivity and reproductive
  outcomes were not statistically significant, perhaps due to the limited sample size,
  but could be used as pilot estimate for large-scale studies investigating the impact
  of C. burnetii infection on reproduction disorders in dairy cattle.

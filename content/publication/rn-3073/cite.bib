 abstract = {Objective To describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 of Canadian companion animal health workers (AHW); to measure their perceived stress and quality of life (QoL); and to explore professional risk factors associated with stress and QoL. Sample We sampled 436 companion animal veterinarians and technicians. Procedure The study had cross-sectional and cohort components. It was conducted online in August to December 2020, and repeated in May to July 2021, using a questionnaire assessing the respondents’ professional characteristics, COVID-19 KAP, perceived stress, and QoL. Results Overall, AHW had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, and reported having adopted good preventive practices. Since the beginning of the pandemic, participants reported increases in new clients (76%), in refusal of new clients (53%), and in pet euthanasia (24%). Increased client refusal and pet euthanasia were associated with greater stress and poorer professional QoL, whereas perceived susceptibility to and adoption of measures against COVID-19 were associated with lower stress and better QoL. Conclusion and clinical relevance For AHW, professional characteristics were associated with stress and professional QoL. This information is important for developing strategies to cope with the ongoing shortage of AHW and with future public health crises.},

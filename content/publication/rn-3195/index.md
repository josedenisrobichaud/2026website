abstract: 'This study aimed to assess how two estrus detection tools, an automated
  activity monitor (AAM) and tail chalk (TC), were associated with true estrus events
  in lactating Holstein cows. Cows with days in milk ≥5 were monitored twice daily
  for estrus alerts, identified by the AAM and a TC score of 3 (<50 % of chalk remaining).
  Transrectal ultrasonography was performed on the day of alert to confirm estrus
  (cows with a follicle ≥10 mm and corpus luteum ≤24 mm). For AAM‐identified events,
  peak activity and duration of estrus were measured. Mixed logistic and linear regression
  models were used to assess associations for dichotomous and continuous outcomes,
  respectively. A total of 1714 events were recorded, of which 1098 from 371 cows
  were considered in true estrus (AAM only: n = 629; TC only: n = 86; AAM + TC: n = 383).
  Cows with both AAM and TC alerts had higher odds of true estrus compared to those
  with only AAM alerts (OR = 4.24; 95 %CI = 3.05–5.87) or only TC alerts (OR = 17.70;
  95 %CI = 11.90–26.34). Cows having AAM and TC alert had greater peak activity index
  (AAM only = 221.64 ± 7.07; AAM + TC = 323.89 ± 9.13) and longer duration of estrus
  (AAM only = 8.37 ± 0.27 h; AAM + TC = 13.17 ± 0.33 h) compared to cows with AAM
  alerts only. In conclusion, TC could be used as a marker of high-intensity estrus
  and, when combined with an AAM, improves identification of true estrus in dairy
  cows.'

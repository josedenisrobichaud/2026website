abstract: The primary objective of this cross-sectional study, conducted in Quebec
  and Bristish Columbia (Canada) between February 2021 and January 2022, was to measure
  the prevalence of viral RNA in oronasal and rectal swabs and serum antibodies to
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) amongst cats living
  in households with at least one confirmed human case. Secondary objectives included
  a description of potential risk factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
  and an estimation of the association between the presence of viral RNA in swabs
  as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical signs. Oronasal and rectal swabs and
  sera were collected from 55 cats from 40 households at most 15 days after a human
  case confirmation, and at up to two follow-up visits. A RT-qPCR assay and an ELISA
  were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in swabs and serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies,
  respectively. Prevalence and 95% Bayesian credibility intervals (BCI) were calculated,
  and associations were evaluated using prevalence ratio and 95% BCI obtained from
  Bayesian mixed log-binomial models.

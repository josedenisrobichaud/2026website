abstract: The objectives of this study were to determine the accuracy of the PortaBHBTM
  milk strip for detection of hyperketonemia in early lactation cows, and to compare
  the agreement of results from quarter and composite samples. A total of 577 Holstein
  cows of all parities, from 88 commercial herds, were sampled once during this study.
  Cows were sampled simultaneously for blood and milk between one and 60 days-in-milk.
  Blood samples were collected from coccygeal vessels, and were analyzed on-farm using
  an electronic ?-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) hand-held meter. Milk samples were collected
  from one quarter (n=577), as well as from four quarters (composite; n=299). All
  milk samples were tested using PortaBHBTM milk strips (0, 50, 100, 200, and 500
  æmol/L). Blood BHBA concentration was considered to be the gold standard, with hyperketonemia
  denned as a blood BHBA concentration ?1400 æmol/L. With this cut-point, the true
  prevalence of hyperketonemia in the study population was 24.6%. Using a threshold
  of 100 æmol/L, sensitivity and specificity of PortaBHBTM milk strips was 89.2% and
  79.6%, respectively. Using a threshold of 200 æmol/L, sensitivity and specificity
  of PortaBHBTM milk strips was 40.3% and 99.5%, respectively. The kappa coefficient
  for agreement between milk results from quarter and composite samples, using a threshold
  of 100 æmol/L, was 0.95. Study results suggest that PortaBHBTM has good accuracy,
  and that there is no benefit to collect milk samples from four quarters compared
  with sampling one quarter.

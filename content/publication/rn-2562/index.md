abstract: 'The objectives of this study were to quantify the effect of an intrauterine
  infusion of cephapirin on reproductive performance at first service of postpartum
  dairy cows affected by purulent vaginal discharge (PVD) and cytological endometritis
  (ENDO) using different diagnostic strategies, and to determine if the presence of
  prolonged anovulation would influence the magnitude of treatment benefit. In total,
  2,259 Holstein cows in 28 herds were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. At
  35 (± 7) days in milk (DIM), cows were diagnosed with PVD using the Metricheck device
  (Simcro, Hamilton, New Zealand), with cytological endometritis using endometrial
  cytology (ENDO-CYTO), and with cytological endometritis using leukocyte esterase
  (ENDO-LE). Regardless of reproductive tract disease status, cows were randomly assigned
  to receive an intrauterine cephapirin infusion or to not be treated. Serum progesterone
  was measured at 35 and 49 (± 7) DIM (14 d apart); cows were considered to have prolonged
  anovulation if progesterone was <1 ng/mL at both times. Reproductive events of cows
  were collected until 200 DIM. Statistical analyses were conducted using multivariable
  mixed logistic regression models. Intrauterine cephapirin treatment was associated
  with an increased first-service pregnancy risk in cows diagnosed with PVD (no treatment:
  15.4%; treatment: 31.4%), ENDO-CYTO (no treatment: 16.2%, treatment: 24.4%), and
  ENDO-LE (no treatment: 15.8%; treatment: 25.1%), but not in cows unaffected by any
  form of reproductive tract disease (no treatment: 34.8%; treatment: 32.6%). Cephapirin
  treatment was also associated with an increased first-service reproductive performance
  in cows affected simultaneously by both PVD and ENDO-CYTO (no treatment: 8.7%; treatment:
  23.4%). The effect of cephapirin treatment in anovular cows (no treatment: 21.0%;
  treatment: 26.4%) was numerically lower than in cyclic cows (no treatment: 22.7%;
  treatment: 34.1%). Overall, an intrauterine infusion of cephapirin improved first-service
  pregnancy risk in cows with postpartum reproductive tract disease and this effect
  was influenced by postpartum anovulation status.'

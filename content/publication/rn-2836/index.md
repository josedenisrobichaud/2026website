abstract: 'Background: The effectiveness of public health measures (PHMs) depends
  on population adherence. Social media were suggested as a tool to assess adherence,
  but representativeness and accuracy issues have been raised. Objective: The objectives
  of this repeated cross-sectional study were to compare self-reported PHM adherence
  and sociodemographic characteristics between people who used Twitter (subsequently
  rebranded X) and people who did not use Twitter. Methods: Repeated Canada-wide web-based
  surveys were conducted every 14 days from September 2020 to March 2022. Weighted
  proportions were calculated for descriptive variables. Using Bayesian logistic regression
  models, we investigated associations between Twitter use, as well as opinions in
  tweets, and self-reported adherence with mask wearing and vaccination. Results:
  Data from 40,230 respondents were analyzed. As self-reported, Twitter was used by
  20.6% (95% CI 20.1%-21.2%) of Canadians, of whom 29.9% (95% CI 28.6%-31.3%) tweeted
  about COVID-19. The sociodemographic characteristics differed across categories
  of Twitter use and opinions. Overall, 11% (95% CI 10.6%-11.3%) of Canadians reported
  poor adherence to mask-wearing, and 10.8% (95% CI 10.4%-11.2%) to vaccination. Twitter
  users who tweeted about COVID-19 reported poorer adherence to mask wearing than
  nonusers, which was modified by the age of the respondents and their geographical
  region (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0.18-1.69
  to OR 4.83, 95% BCI 3.13-6.86). The odds of poor adherence to vaccination of Twitter
  users who tweeted about COVID-19 were greater than those of nonusers (OR 1.76, 95%
  BCI 1.48-2.07). English- and French-speaking Twitter users who tweeted critically
  of PHMs were more likely (OR 4.07, 95% BCI 3.38-4.80 and OR 7.31, 95% BCI 4.26-11.03,
  respectively) to report poor adherence to mask wearing than non–Twitter users, and
  those who tweeted in support were less likely (OR 0.47, 95% BCI 0.31-0.64 and OR
  0.96, 95% BCI 0.18-2.33, respectively) to report poor adherence to mask wearing
  than non–Twitter users. The OR of poor adherence to vaccination for those tweeting
  critically about PHMs and for those tweeting in support of PHMs were 4.10 (95% BCI
  3.40-4.85) and 0.20 (95% BCI 0.10-0.32), respectively, compared to non–Twitter users.
  Conclusions: Opinions shared on Twitter can be useful to public health authorities,
  as they are associated with adherence to PHMs. However, the sociodemographics of
  social media users do not represent the general population, calling for caution
  when using tweets to assess general population-level behaviors.'

abstract: 'Pork and pork products are important staple food in the diet of Vietnamese
  consumers. The safety of pork, including biological contamination, is a concern
  to several public authorities and value chain actors. This cross-sectional study
  aimed to identify Salmonella and total bacterial count (TBC) contamination of cut
  pork sold in different outlets, and determine the potential factors leading to contamination.
  A total of 671 pork samples were collected from different retail channels in three
  provinces in Northern Vietnam. Hygiene conditions and practices at pork vending
  premises were also observed and recorded. Data analysis used descriptive statistics
  and regression analysis. Overall, Salmonella prevalence in retailed pork was 58.1%.
  Salmonella contamination in pork from traditional retail, modern retail and food
  services were 60.5%, 50.9% and 80.5%, respectively. Eighty percent and 68% of fresh
  pork in canteen and street food was contaminated with Salmonella. Only a small proportion
  of a subset of the pork samples (6.2%) tested met the Vietnamese standard requirement
  for TBC contamination. Average concentration of TBC in fresh pork in traditional
  retail, modern retail and food services were 6.51 (SD: 0.64), 6.38 (0.65), and 6.96
  (0.85) LogCFU/g, respectively. Transport time, use of the same tools for pork and
  other types of meat, storage temperature, and environment hygiene are important
  factors that might affect microbial contamination. The findings underline the high
  level of microbial contamination, which requires practical interventions to improve
  food safety hygiene practices and behavior of pork retailers.'

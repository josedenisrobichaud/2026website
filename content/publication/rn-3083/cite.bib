 abstract = {As part of the ProAction on-farm program to implement national biosecurity requirements on dairy farms, Canadian veterinarians are called upon to complete biosecurity risk assessments. The objective of the present study was consequently to understand veterinarians’ perceptions of biosecurity, and to compare perceptions among producer-veterinarian pairs. Questionnaires were administered to 106 producers from Quebec and their veterinarians (n = 82), and the answers of the producer-veterinarian pairs were compared. While most veterinarians reported it was easy to discuss biosecurity with their clients, most veterinarians and producers did not report discussing biosecurity. Moreover, when producers or veterinarians reported discussing biosecurity topics, there was no agreement amongst pairs. Veterinarians also misjudged how their clients perceived the importance and usefulness of biosecurity. Finally, veterinarians reported they had the knowledge and opportunity to assess and discuss biosecurity on dairy farms but lacked skills for evaluating farms and communicating their knowledge.},

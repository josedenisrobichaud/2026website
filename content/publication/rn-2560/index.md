abstract: 'The objectives of this retrospective study were: 1) to determine the sensitivity
  (Se) and specificity (Sp) of leukocyte esterase test (LE), endometrial cytology
  (CYTO) and vaginal discharge score (VDS) for diagnosis of reproductive tract diseases
  in dairy cows at the moment of sampling; 2) to assess the impact of different thresholds
  on test accuracy and misclassification costs; and 3) to quantify herd prevalence
  of reproductive tract diseases in dairy farms from Québec, Canada. Data from 2092
  cows (39 herds) enrolled in two randomized control trials were included. Cows were
  examined at 35 (± 7) days in milk using LE, CYTO, and VDS to determine their reproductive
  tract health status. A latent class model assuming conditional dependence of CYTO
  and LE was fit within a Bayesian framework. Non-informative priors were used for
  the Se and Sp of LE, CYTO, and VDS, while prior information for disease prevalence
  was obtained from expert opinions (mode = 20%, 5th percentile = 10%). Posterior
  inferences (median and 95% Bayesian credible intervals; BCI) were obtained using
  the WinBUGS statistical freeware. An initial model was built using thresholds of
  ≥ 1 (small amount of leukocytes), of ≥ 6%, and of ≥ 3 (mucopurulent discharge) for
  the LE, CYTO, and VDS, respectively. Then, the impact on tests accuracy and misclassification
  costs of using different thresholds was explored. Optimal thresholds balancing the
  need for good antimicrobial stewardship and animal health considerations were proposed.
  The optimal thresholds obtained in the final model were: LE ≥ 2 (moderate amount
  of leukocytes), CYTO ≥ 6%, and VDS ≥ 2 (mucus with flecks of pus). In the final
  model, median (95% BCI) Se for LE, CYTO and VDS were 42.6% (38.8–47.0), 45.9% (41.9–50.7),
  and 64.2% (59.1–70.3), respectively. Median Sp was 90.9% (88.0–93.6) for LE, 92.2%
  (89.2–94.9) for CYTO and 96.6% (91.3–99.8) for VDS. Median within-herd prevalence
  of reproductive tract disease was estimated at 47.9% (39.0–56.7). At a threshold
  ≥ 2 (mucus with flecks of pus), VDS had the highest Se and Sp among the tests evaluated.
  The LE is an interesting diagnostic alternative for detecting reproductive tract
  disease in dairy cows. At a threshold ≥ 2 (moderate amount of leukocytes), LE Se
  and Sp were comparable to those of CYTO. This is the first study reporting the accuracy
  of LE, CYTO, and VDS for diagnosing reproductive tract diseases in dairy cows at
  the moment of sampling.'

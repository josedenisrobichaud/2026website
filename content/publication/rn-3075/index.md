abstract: This study aimed to evaluate animal and ovarian parameters that affected
  fertilization and embryo development up to the morula stage. The data were combined
  from four studies in which cows were inseminated between 46 and 60 days in milk,
  following a synchronization protocol, and flushed for embryo collection five or
  six days later. Parity and body condition score on the day of insemination were
  recorded. Cyclicity, ovarian structures, and circulating hormone concentrations
  before and on the day of insemination were also assessed. The recovered structures
  were graded on a 5-point scale (excellent-good quality, fair quality, poor quality,
  degenerated, and not fertilized). For recovered embryos, the total number of blastomeres,
  the number of nonviable blastomeres, and the number of accessory spermatozoa were
  assessed by epifluorescence microscopy. The risk factors for fertilization and embryo
  quality were identified using cumulative link mixed models. A total of 418 structures
  from 389 lactating Holstein cows (34% primiparous and 66% multiparous) were recovered.
  Thirty-five percent of the recovered structures were excellent-good quality embryos,
  21% were fair quality embryos, 11% were poor quality embryos, 16% were degenerated
  embryos, and 17% were unfertilized oocytes. Structures from primiparous cows, from
  those with greater progesterone concentration at insemination, and from cows with
  seven or less accessory spermatozoa were less likely to be fertilized or of better
  quality than structures from multiparous cows, from those with lower progesterone
  concentration in plasma, and from those with more than seven accessory spermatozoa,
  respectively. Embryos with more blastomeres or without nonviable blastomeres were
  more likely to be of better quality than embryos with fewer blastomeres or with
  nonviable blastomeres. The results of this analysis highlight the importance of
  low circulating concentrations of progesterone near artificial insemination and
  potential positive association with number of accessory spermatozoa reaching the
  embryo and improvement of embryo development up to the morula stage.

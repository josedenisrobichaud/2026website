abstract: The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the operating characteristics
  of a commercial milk leukocyte differential (MLD) test to detect intramammary infections
  in quarters of late-lactation dairy cows as compared to bacteriological culture
  and 2) to evaluate the milk production and udder health parameters between cows
  treated following blanket vs selective dry cow therapy (DCT) using the MLD test
  results. In a first experiment, the MLD test was compared to the bacteriological
  culture results (gold standard) of 363 quarters from 94 cows. The sensitivity, specificity,
  and predictive values for the identification of infection using the MLD test were
  determined. Sensitivity ranged from 44% to 77%, and specificity from 54% to 92%.
  In the second experiment blanket DCT was compared to selective DCT based on the
  results of MLD test, and treating only positive quarters; a total of 328 cows were
  randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. The proportion of quarters positive
  to bacteriological culture, and the incidence rate of moderate and severe cases
  of clinical mastitis events, did not differ between treatment groups. Results of
  these experiments provide information to support decision-making in a selective
  DCT program in low-SCC herds using the MLD test.

abstract: 'This study aimed to evaluate if different concentrations of progesterone
  (P4) before  estrus and different intensities of estrous expression affected endometrial
  gene expression  in lactating Holstein cows. Animals were randomly assigned into
  2 experimental groups:  control P4 and low P4. Cows underwent a presynchronization
  protocol involving a GnRH  injection and P4 implant, followed by a PGF2α injection
  and implant removal after  7 d, and a second GnRH injection 48 h later. The P4 treatment
  began 3 d after the  second GnRH injection, with low P4 cows receiving 3 PGF2α injections
  (12 h apart),  and control P4 cows receiving no PGF2α injections.'

abstract: This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the ability of
  laboratory bacterial culture, Petrifilm, Tri-Plate, luminometry, purulent vaginal
  discharge (PVD), and esterase to correctly identify uterine infection in dairy cows,
  and to assess these tests’ usefulness in different situations. We sampled dairy
  cows between 29 and 43 days in milk in seven farms. We considered all six tests
  imperfect to identify uterine infection and used Bayesian latent class analyses
  to estimate their sensitivity and specificity. We created ten scenarios, including
  tests alone, in series, or in parallel, and we calculated predictive values and
  misclassification cost terms (MCTs). All estimates are presented with 95% Bayesian
  credibility intervals (BCI). A total of 326 uterine samples were collected. The
  laboratory culture had the best validity (sensitivity = 0.87, 95% BCI = 0.77–0.97;
  specificity = 0.71, 95% BCI = 0.58–0.86). The other tests had similar specificity
  but lower sensitivity, with PVD having the lowest sensitivity (0.05, 95% BCI = 0.01–0.10).
  If treating a healthy cow was considered worse than leaving a cow with a uterine
  infection untreated, luminometry yielded an MCT similar to the laboratory culture.
  These findings highlight that the on-farm tools currently used to identify cows
  that could benefit from intrauterine antimicrobial treatment do not identify uterine
  infection accurately. While the laboratory culture was the most accurate test, it
  cannot easily be implemented on farms. Luminometry’s validity was good, but additional
  research is necessary to understand how it can be implemented to improve judicious
  intrauterine antimicrobial use.

abstract: With increased attention to the importance of integrating the One Health
  approach into zoonotic disease surveillance and response, a greater understanding
  of the mechanisms to support effective communication and information sharing across
  animal and human health sectors is needed. The objectives of this qualitative case
  study were to describe the communication channels used between human and animal
  health stakeholders and to identify the elements that have enabled the integration
  of the One Health approach.

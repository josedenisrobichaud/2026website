abstract: 'The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the relationship
  between genomic daughter pregnancy rate (GDPR) with reproduction parameters such
  as pregnancy at first artificial insemination (AI), pregnancy per AI, and pregnancy
  losses (PL). A total of 12,949 events from 3,499 Holstein cows were included. Cows
  were enrolled as nulliparous (n = 1,220), primiparous (n = 1,314), or multiparous
  (n = 965). Cows were bred either after a timed AI protocol, timed embryo transfer
  (ET), or spontaneous estrus. Most lactating cows were bred following a timed AI
  protocol based on estradiol and progesterone, and most nulliparous were artificially
  inseminated following estrus detection. Hair samples were collected from the tail
  switch and cows were genotyped using a SNP platform (Clarifide, Zoetis). Cows that
  were bred by timed AI were evaluated for estrous behavior using tail chalk. Tail
  chalk was applied on the head of the tail 2 d before timed AI and the chalk was
  evaluated at AI (no estrus: 100% of chalk remaining or ≥50% of chalk remaining;
  Estrus: <50% of chalk remaining). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at d 32 and
  60 after AI using ultrasonography, and the presence of a heartbeat was considered
  a positive diagnosis. Pregnancy loss was defined as a pregnant cow on d 32 that
  was nonpregnant on d 60. As GDPR increased, the odds of pregnancy at first AI increased
  [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.20–1.35], the odds of pregnancy per AI increased
  (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.25–1.36), and the odds of PL decreased (OR = 0.66, 95% CI
  = 0.60–0.72). Most cows that were bred on the day of the timed AI demonstrated estrus
  (n = 6,075; 92.9%). The odds of demonstrating estrus on the day of timed AI increased
  as GDPR increased (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17–1.48). There was no interaction between
  GDPR and parity or breeding management for pregnancy at first AI, pregnancy per
  AI, and PL. In conclusion, the odds of pregnancy at first AI and pregnancy per AI
  increased as GDPR increased. Moreover, the odds of PL increased as GDPR decreased.
  Greater GDPR was also associated with greater occurrence of estrus on the day of
  timed AI. These results suggest that selecting for higher GDPR could result in better
  reproductive performance, but this would need to be assessed with additional research.'

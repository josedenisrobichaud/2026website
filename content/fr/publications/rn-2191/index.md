abstract: The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the association
  between pet ownership and quality of life (QoL), loneliness, anxiety, stress, overall
  health, and mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic using a One
  Health perspective. An online bilingual survey was completed by 1500 Canadians in
  April–May 2021. Socio-demographics, health, QoL, stress and anxiety, loneliness,
  social support, pet ownership, and attitude towards pets data were collected. Crude
  and adjusted associations between pet ownership and mental health and well-being
  indicators were estimated. The 1500 participants were from all provinces and territories,
  half were women; half of the participants were pet owners by design. The crude association
  estimates showed that pet owners had poorer QoL, overall health, and mental health
  than non-pet owners, and were lonelier, more stressed, and more anxious than non-pet
  owners. Adjusted estimates showed that these associations disappeared with the inclusion
  of the confounders (socio-economic, demographic, health, and pet-related variables).
  Our results suggest that there was no association between pet ownership and the
  mental health and well-being indicators measured in the present study.

abstract: Objective To describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards
  COVID-19 of Canadian companion animal health workers (AHW); to measure their perceived
  stress and quality of life (QoL); and to explore professional risk factors associated
  with stress and QoL. Sample We sampled 436 companion animal veterinarians and technicians.
  Procedure The study had cross-sectional and cohort components. It was conducted
  online in August to December 2020, and repeated in May to July 2021, using a questionnaire
  assessing the respondents’ professional characteristics, COVID-19 KAP, perceived
  stress, and QoL. Results Overall, AHW had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 transmission,
  and reported having adopted good preventive practices. Since the beginning of the
  pandemic, participants reported increases in new clients (76%), in refusal of new
  clients (53%), and in pet euthanasia (24%). Increased client refusal and pet euthanasia
  were associated with greater stress and poorer professional QoL, whereas perceived
  susceptibility to and adoption of measures against COVID-19 were associated with
  lower stress and better QoL. Conclusion and clinical relevance For AHW, professional
  characteristics were associated with stress and professional QoL. This information
  is important for developing strategies to cope with the ongoing shortage of AHW
  and with future public health crises.

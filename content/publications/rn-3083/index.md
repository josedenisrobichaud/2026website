abstract: As part of the ProAction on-farm program to implement national biosecurity
  requirements on dairy farms, Canadian veterinarians are called upon to complete
  biosecurity risk assessments. The objective of the present study was consequently
  to understand veterinarians’ perceptions of biosecurity, and to compare perceptions
  among producer-veterinarian pairs. Questionnaires were administered to 106 producers
  from Quebec and their veterinarians (n = 82), and the answers of the producer-veterinarian
  pairs were compared. While most veterinarians reported it was easy to discuss biosecurity
  with their clients, most veterinarians and producers did not report discussing biosecurity.
  Moreover, when producers or veterinarians reported discussing biosecurity topics,
  there was no agreement amongst pairs. Veterinarians also misjudged how their clients
  perceived the importance and usefulness of biosecurity. Finally, veterinarians reported
  they had the knowledge and opportunity to assess and discuss biosecurity on dairy
  farms but lacked skills for evaluating farms and communicating their knowledge.

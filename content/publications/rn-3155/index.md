abstract: The objective of this ambidirectional observational cohort study was to
  explore how nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) 22 to 35 d before calving were related
  to NEFA 1 to 14 d before calving and to determine a threshold that could be used
  to identify cows at risk of poor postpartum health. We enrolled 855 dairy cows from
  46 herds, 362 prospectively and 493 retrospectively. NEFA concentration were measured
  during the far-off period (foNEFA; 3 to 5 wk before calving) and in the close-up
  period (cuNEFA; up to 2 wk before calving), and postpartum infectious and metabolic
  disorders, reproduction success, and culling were recorded. Using a split data set,
  we (1) determined a threshold maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity
  to identify peripartum conditions by classifying elevated NEFA and (2) assessed
  the associations between elevated NEFA and altered health and reproduction. The
  associations were expressed as the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% Bayesian credible
  interval (BCI). The concentration of foNEFA varied from 60 to 700 µmol/L (median
  = 149), and a threshold of ≥ 160 µmol/L was identified. Cows with elevated foNEFA
  had greater odds to have elevated cuNEFA (OR = 183, 95% BCI = 52.1–458), hyperketonemia
  (OR = 2.0, 95% BCI = 1.0–3.6), displaced abomasum (OR = 12.3, 95% BCI = 1.6–45.8),
  metritis (OR = 9.4, 95% BCI = 1.3–36.0), and clinical mastitis (OR = 5.8, 95% BCI
  = 1.9–12.1) than cows below the threshold. Our results suggest that foNEFA, using
  a threshold of ≥ 160 µmol/L, could be used by veterinarians as a monitoring or investigating
  tool to assess cows' negative energy balance before calving, even earlier than 2
  wk prepartum. This monitoring could be used to implement early corrective actions
  to prevent the effect of negative energy balance on reproduction and peripartum
  health.

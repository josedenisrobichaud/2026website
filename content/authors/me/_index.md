bio: |
  As a specialist in veterinary preventive medicine with expertise in epidemiology and biostatistics, I focus on applying the One Health approach across various contexts — from animal population health to public health. I’m currently a professor in veterinary livestock management at the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire, Université de Montréal (Rimouski campus), where I have the pleasure of teaching passionate students and leading exciting research projects.

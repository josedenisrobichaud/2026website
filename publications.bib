   abstract = {The objectives of this retrospective study were: 1) to determine the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of leukocyte esterase test (LE), endometrial cytology (CYTO) and vaginal discharge score (VDS) for diagnosis of reproductive tract diseases in dairy cows at the moment of sampling; 2) to assess the impact of different thresholds on test accuracy and misclassification costs; and 3) to quantify herd prevalence of reproductive tract diseases in dairy farms from Québec, Canada. Data from 2092 cows (39 herds) enrolled in two randomized control trials were included. Cows were examined at 35 (± 7) days in milk using LE, CYTO, and VDS to determine their reproductive tract health status. A latent class model assuming conditional dependence of CYTO and LE was fit within a Bayesian framework. Non-informative priors were used for the Se and Sp of LE, CYTO, and VDS, while prior information for disease prevalence was obtained from expert opinions (mode = 20%, 5th percentile = 10%). Posterior inferences (median and 95% Bayesian credible intervals; BCI) were obtained using the WinBUGS statistical freeware. An initial model was built using thresholds of ≥ 1 (small amount of leukocytes), of ≥ 6%, and of ≥ 3 (mucopurulent discharge) for the LE, CYTO, and VDS, respectively. Then, the impact on tests accuracy and misclassification costs of using different thresholds was explored. Optimal thresholds balancing the need for good antimicrobial stewardship and animal health considerations were proposed. The optimal thresholds obtained in the final model were: LE ≥ 2 (moderate amount of leukocytes), CYTO ≥ 6%, and VDS ≥ 2 (mucus with flecks of pus). In the final model, median (95% BCI) Se for LE, CYTO and VDS were 42.6% (38.8–47.0), 45.9% (41.9–50.7), and 64.2% (59.1–70.3), respectively. Median Sp was 90.9% (88.0–93.6) for LE, 92.2% (89.2–94.9) for CYTO and 96.6% (91.3–99.8) for VDS. Median within-herd prevalence of reproductive tract disease was estimated at 47.9% (39.0–56.7). At a threshold ≥ 2 (mucus with flecks of pus), VDS had the highest Se and Sp among the tests evaluated. The LE is an interesting diagnostic alternative for detecting reproductive tract disease in dairy cows. At a threshold ≥ 2 (moderate amount of leukocytes), LE Se and Sp were comparable to those of CYTO. This is the first study reporting the accuracy of LE, CYTO, and VDS for diagnosing reproductive tract diseases in dairy cows at the moment of sampling.},

   abstract = {While One Health initiatives are gaining in popularity, it is unclear if and how they are evaluated when implementation at scale is intended. The main purpose of this scoping review was to describe how One Health initiatives targeting infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance at a large scale are evaluated. Secondary objectives included identifying the main facilitators and barriers to the implementation and success of these initiatives, and how their impacts were assessed. Twenty-three studies evaluating One Health initiatives were eligible. Most studies included the human (n = 22) and animal (n = 15) sectors; only four included the environment sector. The types of evaluated initiative (non-exclusive) included governance (n = 5), knowledge (n = 6), protection (n = 17), promotion (n = 16), prevention (n = 9), care (n = 8), advocacy (n = 10) and capacity (n = 10). Studies used normative (n = 4) and evaluative (n = 20) approaches to assess the One Health initiatives, the latter including impact (n = 19), implementation (n = 8), and performance (n = 7) analyses. Structural and economic, social, political, communication and coordination-related factors, as well as ontological factors, were identified as both facilitators and barriers for successful One Health initiatives. These results identified a wide range of evaluation methods and indicators used to demonstrate One Health's added values, strengths, and limitations: the inherent complexity of the One Health approach leads to the use of multiple types of evaluation. The strengths and remaining gaps in the evaluation of such initiative highlight the relevance of comprehensive, mixed-method, context-sensitive evaluation frameworks to inform and support the implementation of One Health initiatives by stakeholders in different governance settings.},

Socio-demographics, health, QoL, stress and anxiety, loneliness, social support, pet ownership, and attitude towards pets data were collected. Crude and adjusted associations between pet ownership and mental health and well-being indicators were estimated. The 1500 participants were from all provinces and territories, half were women; half of the participants were pet owners by design. The crude association estimates showed that pet owners had poorer QoL, overall health, and mental health than non-pet owners, and were lonelier, more stressed, and more anxious than non-pet owners. Adjusted estimates showed that these associations disappeared with the inclusion of the confounders (socio-economic, demographic, health, and pet-related variables). Our results suggest that there was no association between pet ownership and the mental health and well-being indicators measured in the present study.},

In a first experiment, the MLD test was compared to the bacteriological culture results (gold standard) of 363 quarters from 94 cows. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for the identification of infection using the MLD test were determined. Sensitivity ranged from 44% to 77%, and specificity from 54% to 92%. In the second experiment blanket DCT was compared to selective DCT based on the results of MLD test, and treating only positive quarters; a total of 328 cows were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. The proportion of quarters positive to bacteriological culture, and the incidence rate of moderate and severe cases of clinical mastitis events, did not differ between treatment groups. Results of these experiments provide information to support decision-making in a selective DCT program in low-SCC herds using the MLD test.},

   journal = {Preventive Veterinary Medicine},
   pages = {106521},
   abstract = {This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the ability of laboratory bacterial culture, Petrifilm, Tri-Plate, luminometry, purulent vaginal discharge (PVD), and esterase to correctly identify uterine infection in dairy cows, and to assess these tests’ usefulness in different situations. We sampled dairy cows between 29 and 43 days in milk in seven farms. We considered all six tests imperfect to identify uterine infection and used Bayesian latent class analyses to estimate their sensitivity and specificity. We created ten scenarios, including tests alone, in series, or in parallel, and we calculated predictive values and misclassification cost terms (MCTs). All estimates are presented with 95% Bayesian credibility intervals (BCI). A total of 326 uterine samples were collected. The laboratory culture had the best validity (sensitivity = 0.87, 95% BCI = 0.77–0.97; specificity = 0.71, 95% BCI = 0.58–0.86). The other tests had similar specificity but lower sensitivity, with PVD having the lowest sensitivity (0.05, 95% BCI = 0.01–0.10). If treating a healthy cow was considered worse than leaving a cow with a uterine infection untreated, luminometry yielded an MCT similar to the laboratory culture. These findings highlight that the on-farm tools currently used to identify cows that could benefit from intrauterine antimicrobial treatment do not identify uterine infection accurately. While the laboratory culture was the most accurate test, it cannot easily be implemented on farms. Luminometry’s validity was good, but additional research is necessary to understand how it can be implemented to improve judicious intrauterine antimicrobial use.},

   abstract = {The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify current reproduction management practices, and (2) assess the association between these practices and herd reproductive performance on dairy farms in Canada. A bilingual survey was developed, validated, and administered from March to May 2014 to collect general and reproduction management and performance measures [annual 21-d pregnancy rate (PR), 21-d insemination rate (IR), and conception risk (CR)]. Associations between management practices and reproductive performance measures were tested using linear regression models. A total of 832 questionnaires were completed online and by mail, representing a response rate of 9%. On average, farms had 77 lactating cows (median=50) and 13 dry cows (median=10), and Holstein was the most common breed (92% of herds). Lactating cow housing was tiestall on 61% of the farms, freestall on 37%, and bedded pack on 2%. The average voluntary waiting period was 58 d in milk (DIM). The main reproduction management practice per farm was defined as the means employed for >50% of inseminations. Farms reported their main reproduction management practice for first and subsequent inseminations, respectively, as visual estrus detection (51 and 44% of herds), timed AI (21 and 23% of herds), automated activity monitoring (AAM; 10 and 10% of herds), other management practice (bulls; 2 and 2% of herds), and a combination of management practices (16 and 21% of herds). On farms using visual estrus detection, cows were observed for signs of estrus on average 3.5 times per day, for an average total of 36 min/d. The most common use of reproductive hormones was to synchronize ovulation using Ovsynch (58% of the farms). Average PR, IR, and CR were 17.6, 44.1, and 40.5%, respectively. In linear regression analyses adjusted for confounders, pregnancy rate was significantly associated with geographic region, housing (tiestall: PR=15.4%, freestall: PR=17.6%), herd size (<50 lactating cows: PR=16.2%, 50-100 cows: PR=16.5%, >100 cows: PR=17.8%), voluntary waiting period (≤60 DIM: PR=17.6%, >60 DIM: PR=15.9%), and frequency of insemination per day (once daily: PR=16.6%, twice or more daily: PR=18.1%). The main reproduction management practice at first and subsequent inseminations was divergently associated with IR and CR, but not with PR (visual heat detection: PR=17.4%, timed AI: PR=18.4%, AAM: PR=17.1%, combined practices: PR=18.2%).},

Automated activity monitoring (AAM) systems and timed artificial insemination (TAI) are technologies available to dairy farmers, but many factors can influence their relative performance. The objective of the present study was to compare reproductive performance of cows managed with an AAM system combined with TAI, or with a TAI program (Double Ovsynch) for insemination before 88 DIM. From April 2014 to April 2015, 998 cows from 2 herds were randomly assigned either to be inseminated at 85 ± 3 DIM exclusively using the Double Ovsynch protocol for TAI, or to be inseminated based on estrus detection by AAM without hormonal intervention between 50 and 75 DIM; if no alarm was detected by 75 DIM, cows were inseminated following the single Ovsynch protocol (AAM + Ovsynch). The herds used different AAM systems. Parity, hyperketonemia at wk 1 and 2 postpartum (PP), purulent vaginal discharge at wk 5 PP, body condition score at wk 7 PP, and anovulation to wk 9 PP were recorded. These health indicators did not significantly differ between treatments, but did between herds. The effect of treatment on pregnancy at first insemination and by 88 DIM were assessed using logistic regression models. Time to pregnancy was assessed using survival analysis. Results are reported from intention-to-treat analyses. Treatment did not affect pregnancy at first insemination or pregnancy by 88 DIM, but we found significant interactions between treatment and herd for both outcomes. In herd 2, marginal mean pregnancy at first AI was greater with Double Ovsynch (38%) than AAM + Ovsynch (31%), but no difference was observed in herd 1 (Double Ovsynch = 31%; AAM + Ovsynch = 34%). By 88 DIM, a smaller proportion of cows in herd 1 were pregnant in Double Ovsynch (31%) than AAM + Ovsynch (49%), but there was no difference in herd 2 (Double Ovsynch = 38%; AAM + Ovsynch = 38%). We observed a treatment by herd interaction for median (95% confidence interval) time to pregnancy, which were, in herd 1, 110 (106 to 129) and 98 (88 to 113) d, and, in herd 2, 126 (113 to 139) and 116 (105 to 131) d for the Double Ovsynch and AAM + Ovsynch treatments, respectively. The relative performance of AAM-based reproductive management compared with TAI only is likely influenced by herd-specific variables, in particular related to insemination rate when estrus detection is employed.},

A total of 577 Holstein cows of all parities, from 88 commercial herds, were sampled once during this study. Cows were sampled simultaneously for blood and milk between one and 60 days-in-milk. Blood samples were collected from coccygeal vessels, and were analyzed on-farm using an electronic ?-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) hand-held meter. Milk samples were collected from one quarter (n=577), as well as from four quarters (composite; n=299). All milk samples were tested using PortaBHBTM milk strips (0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 æmol/L). Blood BHBA concentration was considered to be the gold standard, with hyperketonemia denned as a blood BHBA concentration ?1400 æmol/L. With this cut-point, the true prevalence of hyperketonemia in the study population was 24.6%. Using a threshold of 100 æmol/L, sensitivity and specificity of PortaBHBTM milk strips was 89.2% and 79.6%, respectively. Using a threshold of 200 æmol/L, sensitivity and specificity of PortaBHBTM milk strips was 40.3% and 99.5%, respectively. The kappa coefficient for agreement between milk results from quarter and composite samples, using a threshold of 100 æmol/L, was 0.95. Study results suggest that PortaBHBTM has good accuracy, and that there is no benefit to collect milk samples from four quarters compared with sampling one quarter.},

   abstract = {The objectives of this study were to quantify the effect of an intrauterine infusion of cephapirin on reproductive performance at first service of postpartum dairy cows affected by purulent vaginal discharge (PVD) and cytological endometritis (ENDO) using different diagnostic strategies, and to determine if the presence of prolonged anovulation would influence the magnitude of treatment benefit. In total, 2,259 Holstein cows in 28 herds were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. At 35 (± 7) days in milk (DIM), cows were diagnosed with PVD using the Metricheck device (Simcro, Hamilton, New Zealand), with cytological endometritis using endometrial cytology (ENDO-CYTO), and with cytological endometritis using leukocyte esterase (ENDO-LE). Regardless of reproductive tract disease status, cows were randomly assigned to receive an intrauterine cephapirin infusion or to not be treated. Serum progesterone was measured at 35 and 49 (± 7) DIM (14 d apart); cows were considered to have prolonged anovulation if progesterone was <1 ng/mL at both times. Reproductive events of cows were collected until 200 DIM. Statistical analyses were conducted using multivariable mixed logistic regression models. Intrauterine cephapirin treatment was associated with an increased first-service pregnancy risk in cows diagnosed with PVD (no treatment: 15.4%; treatment: 31.4%), ENDO-CYTO (no treatment: 16.2%, treatment: 24.4%), and ENDO-LE (no treatment: 15.8%; treatment: 25.1%), but not in cows unaffected by any form of reproductive tract disease (no treatment: 34.8%; treatment: 32.6%). Cephapirin treatment was also associated with an increased first-service reproductive performance in cows affected simultaneously by both PVD and ENDO-CYTO (no treatment: 8.7%; treatment: 23.4%). The effect of cephapirin treatment in anovular cows (no treatment: 21.0%; treatment: 26.4%) was numerically lower than in cyclic cows (no treatment: 22.7%; treatment: 34.1%). Overall, an intrauterine infusion of cephapirin improved first-service pregnancy risk in cows with postpartum reproductive tract disease and this effect was influenced by postpartum anovulation status.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate animal and ovarian parameters that affected fertilization and embryo development up to the morula stage. The data were combined from four studies in which cows were inseminated between 46 and 60 days in milk, following a synchronization protocol, and flushed for embryo collection five or six days later. Parity and body condition score on the day of insemination were recorded. Cyclicity, ovarian structures, and circulating hormone concentrations before and on the day of insemination were also assessed. The recovered structures were graded on a 5-point scale (excellent-good quality, fair quality, poor quality, degenerated, and not fertilized). For recovered embryos, the total number of blastomeres, the number of nonviable blastomeres, and the number of accessory spermatozoa were assessed by epifluorescence microscopy. The risk factors for fertilization and embryo quality were identified using cumulative link mixed models. A total of 418 structures from 389 lactating Holstein cows (34% primiparous and 66% multiparous) were recovered. Thirty-five percent of the recovered structures were excellent-good quality embryos, 21% were fair quality embryos, 11% were poor quality embryos, 16% were degenerated embryos, and 17% were unfertilized oocytes. Structures from primiparous cows, from those with greater progesterone concentration at insemination, and from cows with seven or less accessory spermatozoa were less likely to be fertilized or of better quality than structures from multiparous cows, from those with lower progesterone concentration in plasma, and from those with more than seven accessory spermatozoa, respectively. Embryos with more blastomeres or without nonviable blastomeres were more likely to be of better quality than embryos with fewer blastomeres or with nonviable blastomeres. The results of this analysis highlight the importance of low circulating concentrations of progesterone near artificial insemination and potential positive association with number of accessory spermatozoa reaching the embryo and improvement of embryo development up to the morula stage.},

   abstract = {<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>The Canadian dairy industry has created national standards to support the adoption of biosecurity practices and to reduce disease risks across the country. There is, however, very little information on the adoption of these practices. The present study aimed to describe the adoption of biosecurity practices on Canadian dairy farms shortly after the creation of the national standards and to identify demographic factors associated with practice adoption. In 2015, 2 questionnaires (phase 1 and 2) were administered to Canadian dairy farmers during an extensive cross-sectional study. Associations between adoption of biosecurity practices as well as associations between adoption of these practices and demographic variables were tested using multiple correspondence analysis. A total of 1,157 questionnaires were completed in phase 1, and a subsample of 368 respondents was selected using stratified random sampling to complete phase 2 during visits to the farms. There was a lack of investigation into general disease syndromes such as a high prevalence of abortion or an unexplained death (38 and 22% of respondents, respectively). Biosecurity measures within herds and between herds to minimize the spread of infection were not widely adopted (e.g., 27% of the respondents never housed sick or lame animals in their calving pen, 41% had closed herds, and 25 and 48% of the open herds had no strategy for introducing new additions and reintroducing returning animals, respectively). Cleanliness of the cows before calving was always ensured by 29% of the respondents, and 27% of the respondents reported always sanitizing the calving pen after each calving. Less than 15% of the respondents had measures in place to limit or control visitors coming on their farm. Moreover, less than half of the respondents reported requiring family members, employees, and visitors to wear farm-designated or clean boots and coveralls. From the multiple correspondence analysis, 2 dimensions were retained and were summarized as "animal movement, calving area, and visitor biosecurity" and "employee biosecurity." Geographical region, type of housing, and milk production were associated with the "employee biosecurity" dimension. The present study demonstrates that many important biosecurity practices are not implemented on Canadian dairy farms; therefore, efforts to promote the adoption of these practices will be necessary to improve biosecurity in dairy herds.</p>},

Questionnaires were administered to 106 producers from Quebec and their veterinarians (n = 82), and the answers of the producer-veterinarian pairs were compared. While most veterinarians reported it was easy to discuss biosecurity with their clients, most veterinarians and producers did not report discussing biosecurity. Moreover, when producers or veterinarians reported discussing biosecurity topics, there was no agreement amongst pairs. Veterinarians also misjudged how their clients perceived the importance and usefulness of biosecurity. Finally, veterinarians reported they had the knowledge and opportunity to assess and discuss biosecurity on dairy farms but lacked skills for evaluating farms and communicating their knowledge.},

   abstract = {The ability of automated activity monitoring (AAM) systems to detect estrus is influenced by multiple variables. The luteal phase (LP) preceding estrus has been shown to be important for hormones release, and behavior during estrus in ruminants, but its impact on activity as measured by AAM systems has not been studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the length of the preceding LP on the intensity and duration of estrus as measured by AAM, and on the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the endometrium. A total of 60 cows between 46 and 53 days in milk were assigned to either a normal or a short length LP. Length of the LP was insured by the use of hormonal synchronization programs. Cows in both treatments were matched on parity, milk production, body condition score (BCS), and lameness score (assessed at enrolment). Expression of ERα receptors in the endometrium were evaluated by nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry of biopsies. Estrus was defined as the day on which the AAM system detected estrus. Cows that were not synchronized by the protocol or that were not detected in estrus by the AAM systems were excluded, which left 21 and 11 cows for analyses in the normal and short length LP, respectively. Peak activity index of estrus, duration of estrus, and expression of ERα were outcomes for multivariable linear regression models. Cows with short length LP tended to have lower peak activity at estrus, but there was no significant effect of treatment when BCS was accounted for. Cows with BCS ≤ 2.5 had less intense and shorter estrus than cows with BCS ≥ 2.75. There was no association between the length of the LP and the expression of ERα in the endometrium.},

It was conducted online in August to December 2020, and repeated in May to July 2021, using a questionnaire assessing the respondents’ professional characteristics, COVID-19 KAP, perceived stress, and QoL. Results Overall, AHW had sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, and reported having adopted good preventive practices. Since the beginning of the pandemic, participants reported increases in new clients (76%), in refusal of new clients (53%), and in pet euthanasia (24%). Increased client refusal and pet euthanasia were associated with greater stress and poorer professional QoL, whereas perceived susceptibility to and adoption of measures against COVID-19 were associated with lower stress and better QoL. Conclusion and clinical relevance For AHW, professional characteristics were associated with stress and professional QoL. This information is important for developing strategies to cope with the ongoing shortage of AHW and with future public health crises.},

   journal = {JDS Communications},
   abstract = {The objective of this ambidirectional observational cohort study was to explore how nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) 22 to 35 d before calving were related to NEFA 1 to 14 d before calving and to determine a threshold that could be used to identify cows at risk of poor postpartum health. We enrolled 855 dairy cows from 46 herds, 362 prospectively and 493 retrospectively. NEFA concentration were measured during the far-off period (foNEFA; 3 to 5 wk before calving) and in the close-up period (cuNEFA; up to 2 wk before calving), and postpartum infectious and metabolic disorders, reproduction success, and culling were recorded. Using a split data set, we (1) determined a threshold maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity to identify peripartum conditions by classifying elevated NEFA and (2) assessed the associations between elevated NEFA and altered health and reproduction. The associations were expressed as the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI). The concentration of foNEFA varied from 60 to 700 µmol/L (median = 149), and a threshold of ≥ 160 µmol/L was identified. Cows with elevated foNEFA had greater odds to have elevated cuNEFA (OR = 183, 95% BCI = 52.1–458), hyperketonemia (OR = 2.0, 95% BCI = 1.0–3.6), displaced abomasum (OR = 12.3, 95% BCI = 1.6–45.8), metritis (OR = 9.4, 95% BCI = 1.3–36.0), and clinical mastitis (OR = 5.8, 95% BCI = 1.9–12.1) than cows below the threshold. Our results suggest that foNEFA, using a threshold of ≥ 160 µmol/L, could be used by veterinarians as a monitoring or investigating tool to assess cows' negative energy balance before calving, even earlier than 2 wk prepartum. This monitoring could be used to implement early corrective actions to prevent the effect of negative energy balance on reproduction and peripartum health.},

   journal = {Journal of Dairy Science},
   abstract = {In this study, the main objective was to assess if long luteal phases could have other causes than pregnancy losses. We enrolled Holstein dairy cows ≥50 d in milk (DIM) from a commercial herd in Brazil from October 2016 to August 2017. All cows received an estradiol-based synchronization protocol, and, on the day of insemination (d 0), were randomly assigned either an artificial insemination (AI) or a placebo insemination (PBO) in a 3:1 ratio. An ultrasound was used to assess the presence of a CL on d17, 24, and 31, which, combined to the information from patches for the detection of estrus, was used to determine the length of the luteal phase following AI or PBO. Pregnancy was assessed by ultrasound on d 31 and cows that were pregnant were excluded from the analyses. The length of the estrous cycles was categorized as short (<17 d), normal (17–23 d), long (24–30 d), and very long (≥31 d). We compared the proportion of cows in each category between the AI and PBO groups using a cumulative ordinal mixed model. We define prolonged luteal phase as estrous cycles ≥24 d and tested its association with potential risk factors (parity, season, DIM, uterine size and position score, milk production, body condition score, and the presence of a corpus luteum (CL) at enrollment to the synchronization protocol) using mixed logistic regression models. Results are presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% credible intervals (BCI). Data from 876 inseminations (AI: n = 616, PBO: n = 260) was collected. Overall, 12% of estrous cycles were short, 31% were normal, 19% were long, and 38% were very long. There was no difference in the odds of being in longer estrous cycle categories for the AI compared with the PBO group (OR = 0.92, 95% BCI = 0.76–1.10). Season and presence of a CL at enrollment were associated with prolonged luteal phase. In the AI group, there was a possible effect of early pregnancy losses on the lifespan of the CL, but not the PBO group, which led us to conclude that long and very long estrous cycles were not all caused by the embryonic loss. In fact, the high prevalence of cows with an extended CL lifespan in the present study suggests this could be an under- or miss-reported characteristic of high-producing lactating Holstein cows. This finding may have important repercussions in the understanding of the CL function physiology of lactating Holstein cows.},

   abstract = {Background: The effectiveness of public health measures (PHMs) depends on population adherence. Social media were suggested as a tool to assess adherence, but representativeness and accuracy issues have been raised. Objective: The objectives of this repeated cross-sectional study were to compare self-reported PHM adherence and sociodemographic characteristics between people who used Twitter (subsequently rebranded X) and people who did not use Twitter. Methods: Repeated Canada-wide web-based surveys were conducted every 14 days from September 2020 to March 2022. Weighted proportions were calculated for descriptive variables. Using Bayesian logistic regression models, we investigated associations between Twitter use, as well as opinions in tweets, and self-reported adherence with mask wearing and vaccination. Results: Data from 40,230 respondents were analyzed. As self-reported, Twitter was used by 20.6% (95% CI 20.1%-21.2%) of Canadians, of whom 29.9% (95% CI 28.6%-31.3%) tweeted about COVID-19. The sociodemographic characteristics differed across categories of Twitter use and opinions. Overall, 11% (95% CI 10.6%-11.3%) of Canadians reported poor adherence to mask-wearing, and 10.8% (95% CI 10.4%-11.2%) to vaccination. Twitter users who tweeted about COVID-19 reported poorer adherence to mask wearing than nonusers, which was modified by the age of the respondents and their geographical region (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0.18-1.69 to OR 4.83, 95% BCI 3.13-6.86). The odds of poor adherence to vaccination of Twitter users who tweeted about COVID-19 were greater than those of nonusers (OR 1.76, 95% BCI 1.48-2.07). English- and French-speaking Twitter users who tweeted critically of PHMs were more likely (OR 4.07, 95% BCI 3.38-4.80 and OR 7.31, 95% BCI 4.26-11.03, respectively) to report poor adherence to mask wearing than non–Twitter users, and those who tweeted in support were less likely (OR 0.47, 95% BCI 0.31-0.64 and OR 0.96, 95% BCI 0.18-2.33, respectively) to report poor adherence to mask wearing than non–Twitter users. The OR of poor adherence to vaccination for those tweeting critically about PHMs and for those tweeting in support of PHMs were 4.10 (95% BCI 3.40-4.85) and 0.20 (95% BCI 0.10-0.32), respectively, compared to non–Twitter users. Conclusions: Opinions shared on Twitter can be useful to public health authorities, as they are associated with adherence to PHMs. However, the sociodemographics of social media users do not represent the general population, calling for caution when using tweets to assess general population-level behaviors.},

Cows were diagnosed with hyperketonemia, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, purulent vaginal discharge, cytological endometritis, leukocyte esterase endometritis, and prolonged anovulation. The prevalence of each of these diseases was computed for every herd. The study outcomes were the prevalence of success at first service, the prevalence of pregnancy loss following pregnancy diagnosis at first service, and the prevalence of postpartum culling (≤60 d in milk). Descriptive statistics of disease and outcome prevalence were computed. Logistic regression models were used to identify prevalence alarm levels associated with poor outcome prevalence. Median herd prevalence for hyperketonemia, retained placenta, displaced abomasum, purulent vaginal discharge, cytological endometritis, leukocyte esterase endometritis, and prolonged anovulation were 18.8, 4.9, 4.0, 5.0, 29.4, 43.8, and 35.2%, respectively. Herds were defined as having low prevalence of success at first service if <40.0%, as having a high prevalence of pregnancy loss if ≥6.3%, and as having a high prevalence of postpartum culling if ≥13.3%. Risk factors for herds having a low prevalence of success at first service were ≥11.8% hyperketonemia, ≥5.0% purulent vaginal discharge, ≥18.8% cytological endometritis, ≥35.3% leukocyte esterase endometritis, ≥21.0% prolonged anovulation, and ≥4.0% of displaced abomasum. Risk factors for herds having a high prevalence of pregnancy loss were ≥5.0% purulent vaginal discharge and ≥4.9% retained placenta. Risk factors for herds having a high prevalence of postpartum culling were ≥23.1% hyperketonemia, ≥4.9% retained placenta, and ≥4.0% displaced abomasum. Overall, postpartum diseases were prevalent in these dairy herds and alarm levels were identified as risk factors for poor reproductive performance and increased culling.},

   abstract = {Metritis affects up to 40% of dairy cows and it is usually treated with antibiotics. In spite of their advantages, there is an increased concern about antibiotic resistance leading to the research of alternative methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a combination of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the prevalence of metritis and modulation of endometrial and neutrophil inflammatory markers in dairy cows. One hundred and thirty-five cows were enrolled 3 week before calving and randomly assigned to three treatments. Treatment groups were: (1) two intravaginal doses of LAB/wk during 3 week pre-calving (vaginal, n = 45); (2) an intra-uterine dose, once 1 d after calving (uterine, n = 44); and (3) no intervention (CTRL, n = 45). Metritis was defined as body temperature > 39.5°C and purulent vaginal discharge (> 50% pus), and diagnosed 6 d after calving. Blood samples were taken at d −14, −10, −7, −4, +1, +3, +6, and +14 relative to calving for non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) analysis. At d −10, +1, +3, and +6 neutrophils were isolated from blood for gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR. Endometrium biopsies were taken from 30 cows, 15 from CTRL and 15 from the uterine group at d +1, +3, and +6 after calving for pro-inflammatory markers analysis by NanoString®. Vaginal treatment reduced metritis prevalence (6/45) up to 58% compared with CTRL group (14/45), but there was no difference between the uterine and CTRL group. Uterine and vaginal treatments reduced blood neutrophil gene expression. Expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the endometrium did not differ between uterine and CTRL cows. Metritic cows expressed more C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) at d 3 than healthy cows, whereas healthy cows expressed more CXCL8 at d 1 relative to calving in the endometrium. This study shows a promising potential of LAB probiotics as a preventive treatment against metritis in dairy cows.},

   abstract = {The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the relationship between genomic daughter pregnancy rate (GDPR) with reproduction parameters such as pregnancy at first artificial insemination (AI), pregnancy per AI, and pregnancy losses (PL). A total of 12,949 events from 3,499 Holstein cows were included. Cows were enrolled as nulliparous (n = 1,220), primiparous (n = 1,314), or multiparous (n = 965). Cows were bred either after a timed AI protocol, timed embryo transfer (ET), or spontaneous estrus. Most lactating cows were bred following a timed AI protocol based on estradiol and progesterone, and most nulliparous were artificially inseminated following estrus detection. Hair samples were collected from the tail switch and cows were genotyped using a SNP platform (Clarifide, Zoetis). Cows that were bred by timed AI were evaluated for estrous behavior using tail chalk. Tail chalk was applied on the head of the tail 2 d before timed AI and the chalk was evaluated at AI (no estrus: 100% of chalk remaining or ≥50% of chalk remaining; Estrus: <50% of chalk remaining). Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at d 32 and 60 after AI using ultrasonography, and the presence of a heartbeat was considered a positive diagnosis. Pregnancy loss was defined as a pregnant cow on d 32 that was nonpregnant on d 60. As GDPR increased, the odds of pregnancy at first AI increased [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.20–1.35], the odds of pregnancy per AI increased (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.25–1.36), and the odds of PL decreased (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.60–0.72). Most cows that were bred on the day of the timed AI demonstrated estrus (n = 6,075; 92.9%). The odds of demonstrating estrus on the day of timed AI increased as GDPR increased (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17–1.48). There was no interaction between GDPR and parity or breeding management for pregnancy at first AI, pregnancy per AI, and PL. In conclusion, the odds of pregnancy at first AI and pregnancy per AI increased as GDPR increased. Moreover, the odds of PL increased as GDPR decreased. Greater GDPR was also associated with greater occurrence of estrus on the day of timed AI. These results suggest that selecting for higher GDPR could result in better reproductive performance, but this would need to be assessed with additional research.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to assess how two estrus detection tools, an automated activity monitor (AAM) and tail chalk (TC), were associated with true estrus events in lactating Holstein cows. Cows with days in milk ≥5 were monitored twice daily for estrus alerts, identified by the AAM and a TC score of 3 (<50 % of chalk remaining). Transrectal ultrasonography was performed on the day of alert to confirm estrus (cows with a follicle ≥10 mm and corpus luteum ≤24 mm). For AAM‐identified events, peak activity and duration of estrus were measured. Mixed logistic and linear regression models were used to assess associations for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. A total of 1714 events were recorded, of which 1098 from 371 cows were considered in true estrus (AAM only: n = 629; TC only: n = 86; AAM + TC: n = 383). Cows with both AAM and TC alerts had higher odds of true estrus compared to those with only AAM alerts (OR = 4.24; 95 %CI = 3.05–5.87) or only TC alerts (OR = 17.70; 95 %CI = 11.90–26.34). Cows having AAM and TC alert had greater peak activity index (AAM only = 221.64 ± 7.07; AAM + TC = 323.89 ± 9.13) and longer duration of estrus (AAM only = 8.37 ± 0.27 h; AAM + TC = 13.17 ± 0.33 h) compared to cows with AAM alerts only. In conclusion, TC could be used as a marker of high-intensity estrus and, when combined with an AAM, improves identification of true estrus in dairy cows.},

The safety of pork, including biological contamination, is a concern to several public authorities and value chain actors. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify Salmonella and total bacterial count (TBC) contamination of cut pork sold in different outlets, and determine the potential factors leading to contamination. A total of 671 pork samples were collected from different retail channels in three provinces in Northern Vietnam. Hygiene conditions and practices at pork vending premises were also observed and recorded. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Overall, Salmonella prevalence in retailed pork was 58.1%. Salmonella contamination in pork from traditional retail, modern retail and food services were 60.5%, 50.9% and 80.5%, respectively. Eighty percent and 68% of fresh pork in canteen and street food was contaminated with Salmonella. Only a small proportion of a subset of the pork samples (6.2%) tested met the Vietnamese standard requirement for TBC contamination. Average concentration of TBC in fresh pork in traditional retail, modern retail and food services were 6.51 (SD: 0.64), 6.38 (0.65), and 6.96 (0.85) LogCFU/g, respectively. Transport time, use of the same tools for pork and other types of meat, storage temperature, and environment hygiene are important factors that might affect microbial contamination. The findings underline the high level of microbial contamination, which requires practical interventions to improve food safety hygiene practices and behavior of pork retailers.},

   abstract = {The bacterium Coxiella burnetii has been associated with reproduction disorders in dairy cattle. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Québec, Canada, to estimate the prevalence of C. burnetii in dairy cows from C. burnetii RT-PCR-positive and/or ELISA-positive herds. As a secondary objective, the associations between C. burnetii-positivity and three reproductive outcomes (purulent vaginal discharge, cytological endometritis, and success at first service) were assessed. A total of 202 post-parturient dairy cows from nine herds were sampled at 35 ± 7 days in milk. Vaginal mucus and composite milk were collected from each cow and screened for the presence of C. burnetii by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA, respectively. Purulent vaginal discharge and cytological endometritis were evaluated using a Metricheck device and a modified cytobrush, respectively. The first insemination postpartum was done following an ovulation synchronization protocol around 70 days in milk, and success at first service was recorded. Multilevel logistic regressions adjusted for parity were used to model purulent vaginal discharge, cytological endometritis and success at first service according to C. burnetii cow status. All 202 RT-PCR-assayed vaginal samples were C. burnetii-negative. A positive result for anti-C. burnetii antibodies detection in composite milk was obtained in 25/202 samples and a doubtful result in 4/202 samples. After adjustment for sampling weights, the 202 ELISA-assayed composite milk samples gave an estimated overall prevalence of C. burnetii positive cows of 12.9 % (CI = 6.1–19.6 %) and of doubtful cows of 1.4 % (CI = 0.0–3.3 %). The proportion of ELISA-positive cows was lower in first parity (0%) compared to second (17.1 %) or third parity cows (20.0 %). The associations between ELISA positivity and reproductive outcomes were not statistically significant, perhaps due to the limited sample size, but could be used as pilot estimate for large-scale studies investigating the impact of C. burnetii infection on reproduction disorders in dairy cattle.},
